    "content": "COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a type of coronavirus. Symptoms range from mild and cold-like to severe and life-threatening.\n\nCoronaviruses have typically caused common colds. But in 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, started infecting humans and causing severe illness. At the peak of the pandemic — when COVID was spreading around the world — tens of thousands of people were hospitalized every day in the U.S. alone. Millions of people have died.\n\nMedical professionals’ understanding has grown a lot since the start of the pandemic. The virus itself keeps changing — we’ve gone through variants alpha, beta, gamma, delta and now omicron. Scientists have developed treatments and vaccines that have reduced the number of people ending up in the hospital.\n\nBut COVID isn’t “over.” It can still make you severely ill, cause symptoms that last months or years, and be fatal."

SARS, a severe respiratory disease that spread between 2002 and 2004, was also a coronavirus.\n\nCOVID spreads through respiratory droplets. This means you can get it from coughing, sneezing and talking. You might also get it from touching contaminated objects and surfaces."

You’re also less likely to get long COVID if you’re vaccinated.\n\nYou can also reduce your risk by washing your hands frequently and wearing a mask when COVID is spreading. Be courteous and avoid being around others if you’re sick or might’ve been exposed to someone who’s sick.\n\nIf you have a compromised immune system, the monoclonal antibody medication pemivibart (Pemgarda™) might be an option. A provider gives it to you in an IV (through your vein) to reduce your risk of getting COVID (pre-exposure prophylaxis)."
